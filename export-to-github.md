3. Save the ZIP file to your local machine and extract it

## Step 2: Initialize Git and Connect to GitHub

   ```

7. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (If your default branch is "master" instead of "main", use that instead)

## Step 3: Setting Up Your Repository

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Add collaborators if needed
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Add project description and topics

## Step 4: Continuing Development

For future development:

1. Clone the repository to your development environment:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SolsticeNavigator.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your database connection in a `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/solstice_navigator
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Important Notes

- Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username
